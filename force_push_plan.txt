FORCE PUSH PLAN - Replace Outdated Remote Master
================================================

CURRENT SITUATION:
- Remote master: v0.1.0 (August 2024 - OUTDATED)
- Your local: v1.0.0 (January 2025 - CURRENT)

DECISION: Force push your v1.0.0 to master (RECOMMENDED)

COMMANDS TO EXECUTE:
====================

1. Force push to master (replaces remote)
   git push --force origin master

2. Push the v1.0.0 tag
   git push origin v1.0.0

3. Also update dev branch (optional but recommended)
   git push --force origin dev

WHAT THIS DOES:
- Overwrites origin/master with your v1.0.0 work
- Removes the outdated August 2024 commits from master
- Makes v1.0.0 the official release

BACKUP (if you want to save remote work):
If you want to preserve the old remote work before overwriting:
   git fetch origin
   git branch backup-old-master origin/master
   # Now force push
   git push --force origin master

NOTE: The old remote work (0.1.0) becomes inaccessible after force push
unless you create a backup branch.

STATUS: Ready to execute
