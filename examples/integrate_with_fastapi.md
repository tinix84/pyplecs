FastAPI integration example

Description

A minimal FastAPI app that sketches endpoints for parsing and running models. Primarily a stub to show how to wire endpoints to `pyplecs` functionality.

Usage

python examples/integrate_with_fastapi.py

Notes

- Requires `fastapi` and `uvicorn` to run the server. If those packages aren't installed the script prints install instructions.
