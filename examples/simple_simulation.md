Simple simulation example

Description

Runs a basic simulation using the `examples/simple_simulation.py` script. The script is defensive: if the PLECS parser or server integration is not available it prints instructions instead of raising.

Usage

python examples/simple_simulation.py

Notes

- Requires `data/simple_buck.plecs` to be present for a full run. The script will notify you if it's missing.
