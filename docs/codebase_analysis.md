# Analysis of PyPLECS Codebase
1. Examine the Main Files
Classes Defined:

ResistorPlecsMdl in plecs_components.py (line 54): Handles resistor parameters and interaction with PLECS server.
ConfigManager in config.py (line 153): Manages centralized configuration.
WebGuiState, McpTool, McpResource in models.py (line 154): Represent web GUI state, MCP tools, and resources.
SimulationRequest, SimulationResult, OptimizationObjective in models.py (line 1): Handle simulation requests, results, and optimization objectives.
CacheBackend in __init__.py (line 18): Abstract base class for cache backends.
Functions That Could Become Methods:

load_param, get_inductance, load_to_plecs in ResistorPlecsMdl.
_initialize_configs in ConfigManager.
dummy_runner in __init__.py (line 80): Could be integrated into a simulation orchestrator class.
Dependencies:

ConfigManager is used by PlecsApp and PlecsServer.
SimulationOrchestrator interacts with FastAPI routes and orchestrates simulations.
CacheBackend is used for caching simulation results.
FastAPI Route Definitions:

GET /parameters in integrate_with_fastapi.py (line 313): Fetches simulation parameters.
POST /simulate in integrate_with_fastapi.py (line 223): Runs simulations.
GET /results/{simulation_id} in integrate_with_fastapi.py (line 223): Retrieves simulation results.
GET /health in integrate_with_fastapi.py (line 266): Health check endpoint.
2. Current Architecture Map
File	Responsibilities
plecs_components.py	PLECS component interaction (e.g., resistor model).
config.py	Configuration management (e.g., loading and validation).
models.py	Core data models (e.g., simulation requests, results, MCP tools/resources).
__init__.py	FastAPI app creation and orchestration.
__init__.py	Abstract cache backend for simulation results.
integrate_with_fastapi.py	FastAPI endpoints for simulation management.
test_api_scenarios.py	API testing scenarios for FastAPI endpoints.
Code Duplication or Tight Coupling:
ResistorPlecsMdl tightly couples parameter handling with PLECS server interaction.
Configuration logic in ConfigManager could be modularized further.
