- [ ] Post weekly "series update" on Friday

### Post-Series (Week 6+)
- [ ] Compile "Best of Series" highlights post
- [ ] Create PDF download of full series
- [ ] Thank readers and solicit feedback
- [ ] Announce next project/series

---

## Metrics to Track

### LinkedIn
- [ ] Views per article
- [ ] Engagement rate (likes + comments + shares / views)
- [ ] Profile visits from articles
- [ ] Follower growth week-over-week
- [ ] Top performing article (for learning)

### Substack
- [ ] Email open rate per article
- [ ] Read completion rate
- [ ] Subscriber growth
- [ ] Click-through to GitHub
- [ ] Share rate

### GitHub
- [ ] Traffic from LinkedIn/Substack
- [ ] Stars on PyPLECS repo
- [ ] Issues/PRs from article readers
- [ ] Forks (adoption indicator)

---

## Backup Plan

### If Engagement is Low
- [ ] Adjust publishing frequency (2×/week → 1×/week)
- [ ] Focus on top-performing topics
- [ ] Add more visuals to subsequent articles
- [ ] Engage in relevant LinkedIn groups/discussions

### If Negative Feedback on AI Collaboration (Article 10)

- [ ] Emphasize 100% strategic decisions by human
- [ ] Share detailed workflow breakdown
- [ ] Acknowledge legitimate concerns about authorship

---

## Legal/Ethical Considerations

- [ ] All code examples are from PyPLECS (open source, MIT license)
- [ ] No proprietary code from other projects
- [ ] AI collaboration disclosed transparently (Article 10)
- [ ] No misleading performance claims (all backed by benchmarks)
- [ ] MIGRATION.md and documentation fairly represent breaking changes

---

5. [ ] Check formatting (headings, bullets, code blocks)
6. [ ] Verify word count within target range
7. [ ] Cross-check metrics against source data
8. [ ] Preview on platform (LinkedIn/Substack) before posting
9. [ ] Have someone else read (if possible)
10. [ ] Take a break, re-read with fresh eyes
