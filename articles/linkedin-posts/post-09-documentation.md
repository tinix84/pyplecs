# LinkedIn Post 9: Documentation - The Feature No One Writes, Everyone Needs

I hate writing documentation.

So I didn't.

**Result: 25 support tickets per week.**

All asking the same questions:
- "How do I upgrade to v1.0.0?"
- "What changed?"
- "Why did my code break?"

Each answer took 15 minutes. That's **6.25 hours per week** answering repeated questions.

Then I spent 8 hours writing MIGRATION.md:

- Every breaking change explained
- OLD code → NEW code examples
- WHY it changed
- HOW to migrate
- Testing checklist

**New support tickets: 3 per week.**

**Time saved: 140 hours per year.**

**ROI: 17.5x return on an 8-hour investment.**

The documentation I created:
- MIGRATION.md: Upgrade guide
- CLAUDE.md: Architecture for developers
- API.md: REST endpoint reference
- INSTALL.md: Setup wizard guide

Each one solved a different pain point.

Here's what I learned:

**Good documentation isn't altruism. It's leverage.**

Every hour spent writing docs saves 10+ hours answering questions.

Every migration guide prevents dozens of "it broke" tickets.

Every architecture doc enables new contributors.

**Documentation is a feature, not an afterthought.**

And the secret? **Auto-generate what you can.**

FastAPI gave us OpenAPI docs for free.
Docstrings → API reference automatically.
Type hints → validation automatically.

Write once, generate many.

What documentation are you avoiding? What's it costing you?
