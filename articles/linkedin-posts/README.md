## Posting Checklist

For each post:

1. **Upload GIF first** (LinkedIn prioritizes video/animated content)
2. **Copy post text** from markdown file
3. **Add hashtags** (5-7 relevant tags at bottom)
4. **Tag connections** (optional: colleagues, influencers)
5. **Schedule for optimal time** (Tue/Thu 8-10 AM)
6. **Cross-link to Substack** (in comments after posting)

## Hashtag Strategy

Use 5-7 hashtags per post from this pool:

**Technical**:
- #SoftwareEngineering
- #Python
- #CodeQuality
- #Refactoring
- #Performance
- #API
- #Testing
- #Documentation

**Thematic**:
- #TechnicalDebt
- #Abstraction
- #YAGNI
- #CleanCode
- #SoftwareArchitecture
- #DeveloperProductivity
- #Engineering

**Trending**:
- #AI
- #FutureOfWork
- #LessonsLearned
- #TechLeadership

**Specific**:
- #PLECS
- #PowerElectronics
- #SimulationEngineering

## Engagement Tips

1. **First 2 lines are critical** - Hook readers immediately
2. **Use line breaks** - Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)
3. **Ask a question** - End with CTA for comments
4. **Respond quickly** - Reply to comments within 24 hours
5. **Share to groups** - Post to relevant LinkedIn groups
6. **Repost top performers** - Reshare best posts after 2-3 months

## LinkedIn Optimization

- **Best posting times**: Tue/Thu 8-10 AM (highest engagement)
- **Post length**: 150-300 words (sweet spot)
- **GIF duration**: 4 seconds (long enough to understand, short enough to loop)
- **Square format**: 800x800px (works on mobile & desktop)
- **File size**: < 5MB (LinkedIn limit)

## Cross-Promotion Strategy

**LinkedIn → Substack**:
1. Post short version to LinkedIn with GIF
2. Wait 2-3 hours for initial engagement
3. Comment on your own post: "For the full technical deep-dive (with code examples, benchmarks, and architecture diagrams), check out my Substack: [link]"

**Substack → LinkedIn**:
1. Publish full article to Substack first
2. Extract punchy 200-word summary for LinkedIn
3. Add custom GIF animation
4. Link back to Substack in comments

## Metrics to Track

- **Impressions**: How many people saw the post
- **Engagement rate**: Likes + comments + shares / impressions
- **Click-through**: Links clicked (to Substack)
- **Follower growth**: New followers gained
- **Top performers**: Which posts resonated most

Target:
- 1,000+ impressions per post
- 50+ reactions
- 10+ comments
- 5+ shares

## Next Steps

1. Review all 10 posts for typos/clarity
2. Generate any missing GIFs (all done ✓)
3. Schedule first post (Week 1 Tuesday)
4. Prepare Substack cross-links
5. Engage with comments daily
6. Track metrics and adjust
